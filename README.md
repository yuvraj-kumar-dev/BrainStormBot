# 🧠 BrainstormBot

> A reflective chatbot that helps you brainstorm your ideas—like talking to your own inner therapist.

## ✨ What is BrainstormBot?

**BrainstormBot** is a simple yet powerful chatbot that helps users reflect on their thoughts, goals, or ideas through meaningful questioning. It is inspired by **ELIZA**, one of the earliest examples of a conversational agent, created in the 1960s at MIT by Joseph Weizenbaum.

Where ELIZA imitated a psychotherapist by responding with open-ended prompts like “Tell me more about that,” BrainstormBot takes a similar approach—but in the context of **creative thinking and ideation**.

Whether you're a:
- 🧑‍💻 Developer refining a startup idea  
- 🎓 Student preparing for a project  
- ✍️ Writer shaping a plot  
- 💡 Thinker stuck in a loop  

...this tool helps **unlock clarity through conversation**.

## 🧬 Inspired by ELIZA

ELIZA was not an AI as we know it today. It used **pattern matching** and **scripts** to simulate conversation and make users feel heard. Despite its simplicity, many users reported deep emotional connections with it.

BrainstormBot is **not powered by LLMs or GPTs** (yet)—but it uses the same reflective principle:  
➡️ *Ask the right question back to the user to make them think.*

## 🧠 Use Case

You tell BrainstormBot an idea like:

> *"I want to build an app that tracks emotions."*

And it might respond:

> *"Why is helping people track emotions important to you?"*

This back-and-forth continues, pushing you to explore **motives**, **clarity**, **audience**, and **next steps**.
